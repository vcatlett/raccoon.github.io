We addressed the data presented by Goldman Sachs, which provides information on the taco and burrito offerings of over 19,000 restaurants around the world. 

We leveled the playing field for small restaurants by creating an unsupervised classification and ranking system based solely on the quality and price menu items. 

We also created a combined data set using public data from Yelp.
